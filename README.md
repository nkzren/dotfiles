# Dotfiles

![WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wtfpl-badge-2.png)

A repository for my highly opinionated dotfiles. Use at your own risk

# How to use this
* Run `install.sh`
* Run `install-omz.sh`
* Be happy with your broken environment

# My Guidelines
* I'll try to use open-source software whenever possible
* Gruvbox everything
* Changes are frequent and may break things, so fork this if you plan to use it

## TODO
* Fix omz auto-updates. Alternately, remove it and keep only zsh
